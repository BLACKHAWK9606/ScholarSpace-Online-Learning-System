2. **Course Content Management**:
   - Instructor uploading course materials
   - Student downloading course materials

3. **Assignment Management**:
   - Instructor creating and publishing assignments
   - Students submitting assignments
   - Instructors grading submitted assignments

4. **Communication Tools**:
   - Announcements system
   - Notifications for important events
   - Discussion forums or chat functionality

5. **User Profile Settings**:
   - Advanced profile customization
   - Notification preferences

6. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Detailed performance reports
   - Learning analytics

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Course Assignment to Instructors
**Problem**: Initial implementation of assigning instructors to courses was not working correctly.

**Solution**: Enhanced the instructor assignment functionality by:
- Improving the instructor display in the assignment modal to show names and specializations clearly
- Adding better error handling and debugging information
- Fixing ID handling to ensure correct instructor-course associations

### Challenge 2: Cross-Service Communication
**Problem**: Ensuring consistent data transfer between microservices.

**Solution**: Implemented standardized DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and established clear API contracts between services.

### Challenge 3: User Authentication Flow
**Problem**: Managing secure authentication across different user roles.

**Solution**: Implemented JWT-based authentication with role-specific claims and proper token validation.

## Architecture Changes

*[Note: Include any changes made to the initial architecture design here, with justifications]*

## Next Steps

1. Implement student course enrollment functionality with admin approval workflow
2. Develop course content management features for instructors to upload and students to access materials
3. Create assignment submission and grading system
4. Add notification system for important events and updates
5. Enhance user profiles and settings
6. Implement advanced analytics and reporting features

## Conclusion

The ScholarSpace LMS has successfully implemented core functionality for user management, course creation, and instructor assignment. The application provides a solid foundation for educational interactions, with a clear path for implementing the remaining features in the next development phase.
