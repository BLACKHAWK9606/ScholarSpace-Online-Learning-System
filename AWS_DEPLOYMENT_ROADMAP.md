# ScholarSpace AWS Deployment Roadmap

## Project Overview
Deploy the ScholarSpace Online Learning System to AWS cloud using modern DevOps practices including Docker, Jenkins, and Terraform. This project serves as a comprehensive learning experience for cloud deployment and CI/CD pipelines.

## End-to-End Deployment Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Use Terraform to provision AWS resources
2. **Containerized Deployment**: Deploy all microservices using Docker containers
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement Jenkins for automated build and deployment
4. **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Utilize AWS services (EC2, RDS, ECR, ALB)
5. **Production-Ready Setup**: Implement monitoring, logging, and security best practices

### Target Architecture
```
Internet → ALB → EC2 Instances → Docker Containers
                              ↓
                           RDS PostgreSQL
                              ↓
                         ECR (Container Registry)
```

### Learning Outcomes
- AWS service integration and management
- Docker containerization and orchestration
- Jenkins CI/CD pipeline creation
- Terraform infrastructure automation
- Production deployment best practices
